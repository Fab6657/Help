The Prefs Editor is the software enables the user to select programmers, select the options when compiling, select the assembler and other settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

It is derived from the Graphical GCBASIC utilities, and requires some files from Graphical GCBASIC to compile.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The software is developed using Sharp Develop v.3.2.1 ( not Visual Studio ).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>COMPILING</strong></span></p><p>Ensure that the "Programmer Editor" folder is in the same folder as a "Graphical GCBASIC" folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The "Graphical GCBASIC" folder must contain the following files from GCGB:
 - Preferences.vb
 - PreferencesWindow.vb
 - ProgrammerEditor.vb
 - Translator.vb
 - ProgrammerEditor.resources</p><p>Once these files are in place, it should be possible to compile the Programmer Editor using SharpDevelop 3.2 (or similar).</p><p><br></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>USING PREFS EDITOR</strong></span></p><p>If run without any parameters, this program will create an ini file in whatever directory it is located in.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If it is given the name of an ini file as a command line parameter, it will use that file.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As well as the ini file it is told to load, this program will also read any files that are included from that file..&nbsp;&nbsp;
This makes it possible to keep the settings file in the Application Data folder if GCBASIC is installed in the Program Files directory..&nbsp;&nbsp;
To put the settings file into the Application Data folder, create a small ini file containing the following 3 lines and place it in the same directory as this program:</p><pre class="screen">    include %appdata%\gcgb.ini
    [gcgb]
    useappdata = true</pre><p>The include line tells the program (and GCBASIC) to read from the Application Data folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The useappdata=true line in the [gcgb] section will cause this program to write any output to a file in Application Data called gcgb.ini.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The hard coding of GCGB is required this program is based on GCGB.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It will result in programmer definitions being shared between GCGB and any other environment using this editor, which may be a positive side effect.</p><p><br></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>BUILDING THE PROGRAMMER EDITOR EXECUTABLE USING SHARP DEVELOP</strong></span></p><p>To build Prefs Editor from the source files.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The list shows the installation of the Sharp Develop IDE.</p><p>Complete the following:</p><pre class="screen">        1. Download and install Sharp Develop from  https://sourceforge.net/projects/sharpdevelop/files/SharpDevelop%203.x/3.2/[SourceForge]
        2. Download the Prefs Editor source using SVN into a source folder.  This is the folder ..\utils\Programmer Editor
        4. Run Sharp Develop (installed at step #1).  Load project  "Programmer Editor.sln"  from source source folder.
        5. Hit &lt;f8&gt; to compile.</pre><p><br>
