=== #ifnot

*Syntax:*
[subs="quotes"]
----
    #ifnot __Condition__
      ...
    [#else]
      ...
    #endif
----
*Explanation:*

The `#ifnot` directive is used to prevent a section of code from compiling unless `_Condition_` is false.

`_Condition_` has the same syntax as the condition in a normal GCBASIC if command. The only difference is that it uses constants instead of variables and does not use "then".

*Example:*
----
    'This program will set the constant to true only if NOT a PIC family
    #chip 16F88, 8

    #ifnot ChipFamily = 14

      #define myConstant True

    #endif
