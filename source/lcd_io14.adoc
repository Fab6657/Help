===== LCD_IO 14

*Using connection mode 14:*

Using this LCD IO methof the LCD is controlled via an SPI expander.

To use mode 14 you must define the SPI ports as normal in your GCB code.
Then, define the LCD type, set the SPI address of the SPI expander, and, the LCD speed, if required.

*Relevant Constants:*

These constants are used to control settings for the LCD routines included with GCBASIC.&#160;&#160; To set them, place a line in the main program file that uses `#define` to assign a value to the particular constant.

When using this mode only three constants are mandated - all others can be ignored.

*Connectivity*

The connectivity is shown below.&#160;&#160;The microcontroller connections are as shown below.&#160;&#160;This is an example using the Microchip Explorer 8 board.



----
    RC3 > Expander SPI SCK ( clock)
    RC5 > Expander SPI SI (slave in)
    RA2 > Expander SPI CS ( chip select) - could be set to 0v0
    RB5 > Expander Reset ( optional)

*Optional configuration*


There are some options you can tweak. See the example setup below. You can play with the use of hardware or software SPI, SPI frequency ( HWSPIMODE MASTERFAST). LED speed, the connectivity between the expander and the LCD and otheroptions.
