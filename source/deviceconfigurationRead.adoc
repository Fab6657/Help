*Syntax:*
[subs="quotes"]

----

    deviceconfigurationRead (_location, store_)

----

*Command Availability:*

Available on all Microchip PIC microcontrollers with self read capability. Not available on
Atmel AVR at present.

*Explanation:*

`deviceconfigurationRead` reads information from the configurations area of the  memory on chips that
support this feature. `_location_` and `_store_` are both word variables,
meaning that they can be values greater than 255.

The  `_location_` depends on the amount Microchip PIC microcontroller, which is given on the datasheet. `_store_` is
14 bits wide, and thus can store values up to `16383`.

This is an advanced command which should only be used by advanced developers.
